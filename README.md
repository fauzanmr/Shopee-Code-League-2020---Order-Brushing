# Shopee-Code-League-2020---Order-Brushing

My team participated in the Open category,

Meaning of Order Brushing : is a technique of "polishing" orders. In this technique, sellers can create fake orders that increase engagement, or the reputation of the seller or a particular item in the rankings. The goal is to rank the seller or item on Shopee's search results.

Objective of the post:

-Identify all shops that show signs of using the order brushing technique.
-In these shops, identify users who have signs that they are actually ordering brushing for that shop.
